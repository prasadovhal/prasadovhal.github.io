I always cherish the arrival of Spring, following a lengthy, piercing Winter in Oregon. Spring breathes new energy and enthusiasm, with a multitude of flowers blossoming in the valley. And who could overlook the buzzing bumble bees, humming around the campus grounds? The unforgettable beauty is something I could never leave behind! 

Allow me to share a few glimpsesâ€¦
