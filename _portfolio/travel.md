My travels across India have taken me from the bustling streets of Mumbai to the serene landscapes of Konkan. I’ve explored historical sites in Satara, Solapur, and Nashik, each with its unique cultural heritage. My spiritual journeys led me to Ujjain and Omkareshwar, while Indore showcased vibrant city life. Goa’s beaches, Bangalore’s urban vibes, and the lush greenery of Coimbatore and Ooty offered a perfect mix of relaxation and adventure. and much more.....
