Every weekend, usually on Saturday or Sunday, I wake up at 4:30 a.m. for a 40-minute hike to reach the top, just in time to watch the sunrise. Each season brings a different view, adding a fresh perspective to the routine I've followed for the past three years. This peaceful moment brings me inner silence and keeps me grounded in my life goals.

Allow me to share a few glimpsesâ€¦
