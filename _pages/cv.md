Education
======
* Ph.D in Environmental Sciences and Applied AI, 2025 (expected)
* Masters in Mathematical Modeling and Simulation, Centre for Modeling & Simulation, Pune, 2019
* B.E. in Automotive Engineering, Pune University, 2017

Work experience
======
* 2023-2025: **Graduate Research Assistant**
  * Oregon State University
  * Predicting Critical transition via hybrid data-driven model in Socio-Economic Ecological models.
  * Working with Socio-Environmental Analysis (SEA) Lab on data-driven ecology.
  * Supervisor: [Dr. James Watson, CEAOS, OSU](https://ceoas.oregonstate.edu/directory/james-watson)


* 2022-2023: **Graduate Teaching Assistant**
  * Oregon State University
  * Explainable AI for Computer Vision DL models and LLMs, Scientific Machine Learning
  * Working on Explainable AI project, building human-understandable explanations for DL models.
  * Supervisor: [Dr. Prasad Tadepalli, EECS, OSU](https://engineering.oregonstate.edu/people/prasad-tadepalli)

* Summer 2023: **AI/ML Intern**
  * Seagate Technology LLC
  * Supervisor: Addishiwot Woldesenbet
  * Led the integration of Generative AI and Large Language Model (LLM) technologies into enterprise applications.
  * Developed and optimized LLM models by prompt engineering to convert natural language inquiries into structured and unstructured database queries. This implementation significantly reduced query time, enhanced usability for users unfamiliar with SQL database, and minimized human errors.
  * Played a key role in the exploration, design, evaluation and implementation of efficient data processing pipelines, thereby improving overall system performance.

* 2019 - 2021: **Senior ML Engineer**
  * Persistent Systems, Pune, INDIA
  * Supervisor: Dr. Kaustubh Waghmare, Kshitij Deshmukh
  * Time-Series Forecasting and Anomaly Detection: I developed and implemented algorithms for analyzing network traffic across the organization. This involved the use of time-series forecasting and anomaly detection techniques.
  * Data Exploration for Machine Learning Models: I conducted extensive data exploration to assess the feasibility of machine learning models for privilege access management applications. This initiative significantly enhanced our network security protocols.
  * Entity and Link Extraction Models: As part of a large-scale team, I developed models for entity and link extraction. This enabled us to create structured and graphical representations of entertainment news.
  * Real-Time Sentiment Analysis Platform: I created a state-of-the-art text summarization streaming platform. This platform was used for real-time sentiment analysis, leveraging the latest technology.

* Jan-July 2019: **ML Intern**
  * Persistent Systems, Pune, INDIA
  * Supervisor: Kshitij Deshmukh
  * Organizational Network and Data Analytics Tool: I conducted research and development for a tool designed to analyze organizational networks and data. This project involved visualizing the network and interaction of 10k+ employees.
  * Feedback Summarization and Analytics Tool: I developed a machine learning-based tool for summarizing and analyzing survey feedback. This tool was designed to extract key insights from large volumes of survey data, enabling efficient decision-making for human resources.
  * Chatbot Performance Enhancement: I designed, reconstructed, and implemented a framework to enhance chatbot performance. This involved the use of human feedback learning to continuously improve the chatbot's responses and overall user experience.
  * Explanation for Deep Learning models: Implemented and evaluated explainable AI techniques for deep learning models trained on medical image data.
