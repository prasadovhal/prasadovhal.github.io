Black hole (BH) meta-heuristic optimization is a nature-inspired algorithm which mimics the behavior of black holes. The Black hole algorithm framework is implemented in this work to solve dynamic optimization of some benchmark problems encountered in chemically reacting systems. We have employed two different algorithm types which include a standalone black hole algorithm and an algorithm which combines exploration–exploitation tradeoff in the algorithm. This tradeoff is enabled through the concept of white hole (WH). We have employed both piecewise linear and piecewise constant control profiles in our simulations. The algorithms proposed are simple and are easy to implement. Case studies studied show that the novel algorithms are robust and compare very well with existing algorithms.
