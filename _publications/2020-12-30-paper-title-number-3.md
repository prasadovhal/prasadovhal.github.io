Linear regression models are traditionally used to capture the relation between the input and output variables. Linear models cannot account for the nonlinear relations in the data. Hence, the prediction models may not be accurate. For this reason, machine learning-based models are being increasingly used. For modeling, design, and scale-up of rotating disc contactors (RDCs), rational estimation of dispersed-phase holdup and drop size is crucial. We have employed random forest (RF) and autoencoder–RF-based models for the prediction of dispersed-phase holdup and drop size in RDCs. Our results show that both these models predict drop size quite well. For holdup, the autoencoder–RF combination predictions are not satisfactory. The standalone RF model predictions generalize very well. RF-based models can be further used for prediction of different variables of interest in RDCs.
