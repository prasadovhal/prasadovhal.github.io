In this novel feature selection algorithm, each star represents a distinct subset, and the black hole represents the subset having the best fitness. The iterative movement of stars toward the black hole facilitates discovering the best subset. In this work, we have presented a hybrid feature selection algorithm coupling the existing binary black hole algorithm with an existing binary genetic algorithm. In this new algorithm, the control switches between the black hole and genetic algorithms. We have introduced the concept of switching probability parameters to facilitate the switching between the black hole and genetic algorithms. Our optimally tuned hybrid algorithm in terms of the switching probability improves the algorithm performance considerably.
